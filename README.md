# Slightly Better Splashes
Slightly improves the splash text in the main menu

### Features
- Shows a different splash every time you enter the main menu, without having to enter a world
- Allows multiline splash text rendering, does some ✨*m a g i c*✨ to auto✨*m a g i c a l l y*✨ wrap the splash
  text when it's too long, allowing for some funny long texts that cover over half of the screen
